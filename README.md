Ribbit Network is a large network of open-source, low-cost, Greenhouse Gas (CO2 and hopefully other gasses in the future) Detection Sensors. These sensor units will be sold by the Ribbit Network and will upload their data to the cloud, creating the world's most complete Greenhouse Gas dataset.

This respository contains the software for the Frog Sensor.


## Current Software

The current Ribbit Network Frog software is being developed for the [Frog Sensor Version 4.](https://github.com/Ribbit-Network/ribbit-network-frog-hardware)

## Building the Software

Fetch the submodules:

```shell
$ git submodule update --jobs 32 --init --recursive
```

Run tests:

```shell
$ make test
```

Build the firmware:

```shell
$ make build
```

Flash the firmware to a device connected to `/dev/ttyACM*`:

```shell
$ make DEVICE=/dev/ttyACM0 flash
```

## Setting Golioth Config

```shell
import ribbit.config as _config
registry.config.set({"golioth.user": "<user>", "golioth.password": "<psk>"})
```

### Disabling OTA
```shell
import ribbit.config as _config
registry.config.set({"golioth.ota.enabled": False})
```
